# Elixir Application Challenge

This project implements a bank system where users can transact money. The rules and specifications from it come from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/thulio/e021378b27ff471795e37ba5a5b73539).

This project is also a try to learn StoneCo's best practices for git style, present [here](https://github.com/stone-payments/stoneco-best-practices).
